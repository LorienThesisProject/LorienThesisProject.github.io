        Reza
    </h1>
    <p>
        Reza fled to the United States from Iran following the Iranian Revolution in the late 1970s.  
        He first went to Germany, and then landed in the US, finally settling in Colorado in 1988.  
        He met his wife, Carol, upon his arrival, and the two clicked so well that they married soon after.

    <p>
        Reza and Carol had a baby boy, Bijan.  
        Reza has worked as a chauffeur to support his family, and was married to Carol for seventeen years before she died from Huntingtonâ€™s Disease.

        Now, Reza loves being a doting grandfather to his granddaughter Eliana.  
        Despite all that he has endured, he insists that he is very blessed.  
        He is a proud uncle, father, father-in-law, and even dog owner.  
        He has spent thirty years in Colorado, longer than he has lived anywhere else.  
        Reza is looking forward to moving to Kentucky soon to spend more time with his son, daughter-in-law, and baby Ellie.
