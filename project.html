    <h1>About <i>The Heard</i></h1>
        <p>
          This endeavor is the final step in my journey towards a masters degree in Media and Public Engagement from the University of 
          Colorado, Boulder.  I entered the degree program to gain the skills to become an informed producer, which would allow me to 
          create a platform to elevate the voices of marginalized populations whose voices otherwise tend to go unheard.
        </p>
        <p>
          Borne of my own curiosity, this endeavor sought to gain insight into the everyday lives of
refugees. I wanted to know what makes them unique, what their journeys and lives have truly
been like, the challenges they face and the joys they experience. More than their differences, I
wanted to see how we are much the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have not seen many projects that focus on individual refugees, or that allow them to
share their stories in their own voices. Their stories are told for them and are shaped inevitably
by the interests and concerns of the storyteller. Often refugees do not even have a say in
approving the narratives that are shared. For me, that wasn't good enough. I wanted to hear
what refugees themselves had to say. I wanted to offer something different and more powerful
because it would let refugees speak for themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          With that in mind, I chose to use an interactive documentary format. Interactive
documentaries force the reader out of a traditional linear narrative. They employ a variety of
different media including text, audio, and video. No two look alike. They may send the
audience on different paths, depending on what they select on the website, thread them back
through the story, or allow them to explore common themes. Mine employs a concentric
narrative model, offering ideas around a shared central point: the authentic humanity of refugees.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reason I chose to create a platform as opposed to doing a simple documentary is that
a platform facilitates a much broader engagement. Not only does it have the power of visual
stories, the menu allows participants to explore. As the audience is drawn in, they can learn
more about the facts and break down misconceptions surrounding refugees. It offers ways for the
audience to further engage with the issue and adopt it as their own, from a simple act of making a
donation to a much greater commitment of adopting a refugee family and helping them navigate
life in their new country.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though still through my camera lens and therefore my point of view, I took every step I
could to allow the refugees to guide their own stories. I had prompt questions, but also took
pains to ask what they wanted people knew, what they loved, what their lives were like, what
challenges they faced. Each person had a lifetime of experiences before they came here, and will
have a lifetime of experiences yet to come. I wanted to learn about their past and hopes for the
future, but also to understand more of what life is like for them here and now.
        </p>
        <p>
          My website is intended to function as a story quilt. For many of us, we have had very
little interaction with refugees; we know very little of their realities. Though merely an
introduction, it allows the audience an opportunity to gain insight. It gives them a taste that will
hopefully leave them wanting to learn more. I used video purposely to allow the individuals own
voices to shine through, coupled with a textual biography in which I share some of what I
learned about each one during my time spent with them.
        </p>
        <p>
         I began my project wanting to learn as much as I could about refugees as people rather
than an issue. In the process, I found myself not only attracted to them, but wanting to influence 
people on their behalf because of injustices that they have suffered not only in their homeland,
but in ours. I hope to break down misconceptions and provide insight into the lives of refugees.
I want to persuade people who come to the issue with a negative attitude, separate myth from
reality for them, and offer opportunities for those who want to do more. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Moving forward, I would love to continue to add voices to the story of refugees; thus
adding to its richness. My desire is that this project will move people towards understanding and
involvement. I hope that people will begin to see refugees as community members with much to
offer, and to do what they can to seek, welcome, help, and integrate these new neighbors.
        </p>
        
        <h1><b>Theoretical Framework</b></h1>
        <p>
          Stuart Hall questions who gets the privilege of writing history.  There is a danger in essentialism; boiling a category of 
          people down to having an underlying or unchanging essence.  Hall argues that we must have a dialogic approach.  Refugees are 
          active agents in their own lives and should be treated as such.  With this project, I attempted to use my privileged position 
          as a producer to allow refugees to share their histories and realities as they saw fit, rather than forcing them into a box.

        </p>
        <p>
        Critical theory describes subalterns - populations that are socially, politically, and geographically outside of the hegemonic 
        power structure of the colony and of the colonial homeland.  In Can the Subaltern Speak?, GC Spivak delves into ideas of 
        narrativity and representation of the subaltern.  Not only are subalterns frequently not the ones telling their own stories, 
        but they are often told as a single story: one that is not healing, helpful, or even accurate.  They are used for convenient 
        narratives.  Subjects often do not even have a say in approving the narratives that are shared.  Though there are obvious power 
        dynamics at play, I did my best to make sure that refugees approved of their own representations, that they genuinely affirmed 
        them, and that the stories were what they wanted to share.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the Western world, people are frequently viewed in terms of western and nonwestern - the other versus us.  There is a myth 
          of Western exceptionalism, which allows us to view the United States as the pinnacle of the world; the peak of civilization - 
          a notion that often leads people to believe that letting in outsiders would taint this.   The author Edward Said describes 
          this as orientalism.  Orientalism is “a way of seeing that imagines, emphasizes, exaggerates and distorts differences of Arab 
          peoples and cultures as compared to that of Europe and the U.S. It often involves seeing Arab culture as exotic, backward, 
          uncivilized, and at times dangerous,” (www.arabstereotypes.org).  However, Orientalism is nothing more than a strawman.  
          It is easier to point out the differences rather than view the similarities and come to an understanding.  
        </p>
        <p>
          Refugees are frequently depicted as outsiders, as others, as the “unfortunate”, as Luc Boltanski describes.  
          Theodor Adorno as well describes race relations as nothing more than a commodity in which people of color are used to 
          describe exceptions to the norm.  Many of the representations that are put forth serve only to confirm what we already believe.
          This project is intended to serve as a direct challenge to these notions.  It shies away from exoticizing the refugees, as they
          are frequently depicted.  Rather, it purports to humanize them, show that they are ordinary people just like you and I, and 
          strips away the otherness - allowing them to depict themselves and share their own stories as they see fit.
