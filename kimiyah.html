    <p>
        Kimiyah is Ethiopian, Oromo, from the capital Addis Ababa.  
        She is one of twelve children.

    <p>
        In Ethiopia, she could have been killed if anyone found out she was Oromo.  
        She fled to Kenya where she lived for five years. 
        Without proper paperwork, she was in danger of being arrested at any time.

    <p>
        Kimiyah has now been in the United States for 13 years and is a proud citizen. 
        She keeps close tabs on the news in Ethiopia, which makes her even more grateful for her freedom here.  
        She spends much of her time with her daughter and granddaughter, and loves taking them to her favorite restaurant - Golden Corral.
